    1-1) Download the iris-data-3 from Canvas, use pandas.read_csv to load it. This dataset has 5 input features: [sepal_length, sepal_width, petal_length, petal_width, color]
    1-2) Find and drop duplicate samples (use "ID" to find duplicates)
    1-3) Split your data into train(70% of data) and test(30% of data) via random selection

    2-1) Train a KNN classifier for the (k = 5, metric='manhattan'). Did you encounter an error? what is the error? how can we fix it?
    Fix the error and train your model. (Hint: pandas.get_dummies())
    2-2) Test your classifier with the test set and report the results.
    2-3) Print the confusion matrix for the results on the test set.

    3) Test your trained model with the given test set below and report the performance.
